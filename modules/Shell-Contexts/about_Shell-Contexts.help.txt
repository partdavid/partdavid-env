SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Set "contexts" of various kinds for your shell command-line

LONG DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to configure named contexts for your shell
    command-line. It's inspired by and integrates with context
    managers like rbenv, kubectl context commands, etc.

    The basic idea is that you create a YAML config file at
    ~/.config/shell-contexts/contexts.yaml which contains a mapping,
    whose top-level keys are the names of the contexts you'd like to
    set (e.g. "dev", "production", "python3" or something). When you
    do 'Set-CurrentContext dev' (usually using the "use" alias), the variable
    settings you've specified and commands you'd like to run upon
    entering the context are performed (and reversed when you leave
    the context). A Cmdlet is provided so you can include the context
    in your prompt, decorated with the collor you specify.

    The format of the file and how its values work, and how contexts
    inherit from each other, is documented in Set-CurrentContext, usually
    aliased to 'use'.

# 1Password-Utilities

This is the _wrong_ but useful approach to handling secret data from
1Password.  The right approach is to write a provider for
[SecretManagement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/secretmanagement-and-secretstore-are-generally-available/)
as described in
[this thread](https://1password.community/discussion/116802/is-there-any-planned-support-for-the-powershell-secretmanagement-module).

However, I find these utilities useful even so.
